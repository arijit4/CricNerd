	Live Cricket scores, Ad-free

## Screenshots



## Features
- Almost live scores (as fast as [ndtv](https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket))

- Easy to use and user-friendly.

- [Material Design 3](https://m3.material.io/) style clean and modern UI, with [dynamic color](https://m3.material.io/foundations/customization) theme.

- MAD: UI and logic written with pure Kotlin. Single activity, no fragments, only composable destinations.

## Help need :sweat:

I'm a develper by passion. I'm not so good at UI/UX and graphic designing.
I need help to
1. Make the UI/UX more pleasant.
2. Change the app logo as it is copied for an online poster.
3. Update overall appearance of this app.

Please feel free to DM me at [Telegram](https://t.me/arijit_paul)
